# Bake-My-Cake
Bake My Cake is a React-based single-page application (SPA) designed to provide customers with a seamless online browsing and ordering experience for cakes, cookies, and brownies. The development is structured into two phases to ensure a robust and user-friendly application. In the first phase, the app allows users to view a list of available baked goods, each displayed with an attractive image, price, and rating. It includes a search and filter functionality, enabling users to quickly find products based on their preferences. To ensure reliability, unit test cases are written for each component.

In the second phase, the application is enhanced with Material Design principles, offering a visually appealing and rich user experience. Users can select a specific item to view a detailed description, including ingredients, reviews, and specifications. Additionally, the app allows customers to place an order by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, delivery address, and quantity. A confirmation message is displayed upon successful order placement. With a strong focus on aesthetics, usability, and functionality, Bake My Cake ensures a smooth shopping experience, making it easy for customers to explore, select, and order baked goods effortlessly.
